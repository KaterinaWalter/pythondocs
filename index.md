### Course Overview
> The _Post-AP Computer Science_ course offers highly motivated students the opportunity to expand on topics covered in the Pre-AP and AP courses. Modern applications of the `Python` language are highlighted, including **Data Science & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with `pandas`/`matplotlib`/`seaborn`, dynamic web applications with `Flask`, database operations with `SQL`, and **Machine Learning & AI**.
