## Introduction to machine learning using Python!
### What is an AI?

Machine learning or AI is a way computers can learn.
AI can do many useful tasks such as:

- Writing
- Generating Images
- Send Emails

### How does AI work?

The way AI works, 
is that it gathers data from a bunch of different sources and sort of trains the AI.
Then using that data set, when you input, 
it feeds it in and the AI uses its data set to predict the next word, 
or pixel in the case of image generation.

This can lead to AI's being misled in math or science as the AI
just predicts the answer, so if it's never seen that math problem or science question,
it will make up something in its dataset.
