## End-of-the-Year Project

The final part of this course is dedicated to pursuing an open-ended **passion project**! Over the next few months, you will all get to dive into (_almost_) any kind of coding that interests you – whether you want to **build an impressive program** for your portfolio using skills we've learned in class, or **explore something totally new** in the field of technology.

⚠️ You will be required to **plan ahead**, **set goals**, and **manage your time effectively** in order to complete your project by the end of the year. The criteria for a "completed project" will look different for everyone, but ultimately, the goal is to create a **working program** that you are *proud of* and demonstrates _advanced skills_ or _new knowledge_. 

### 📚 Ideas & Resources

#### Python Programming
* Build a creative `Python` **web-app** that implements the `Flask` techniques we learned in [Unit 3](https://coderina.dev/pythondocs/unit03)
  > _The possibilities are endless here!_ You could make something fun and interactive for your friends to use, or a useful app for tracking/organizing certain information in your daily life, or a page that showcases your interests and hobbies, etc. I would expect this app to be **more complex** than any of the projects created in the last unit.  
* Combine skills: create a `Flask` application that incorporates **data visualization** (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`) from [Unit 2]()
  > _Example:_ This [Timestamp Analyzer for Google Docs](https://coderina.pythonanywhere.com/) is a web-app I made that processes text data and generates a bar chart. 
* Explore the world of **machine learning & artificial intelligence** by following self-guided online tutorials. I recommend **Kaggle**'s `Python` courses in [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning) and [Intro to Game AI and Reinforcement Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-game-ai-and-reinforcement-learning).
  > _NOTE:_ If you choose to pursue a project that requires spending time on tutorials like this, that will be factored into the expectations for your project. You wouldn't be required submit a project of the same level of complexity as I would expect for a Python web-app, but make sure to produce some sort of **working program** that demonstrates creative effort. 

#### Other Languages & Software
* Want to learn how to **develop games**? _Here are my recommended paths:_
  * [Unity Game Engine]() that uses the `C#` programming language, which is similar to `Java`. 
* Interested in **cybersecurity**? _Here are some ideas:_
  * ADD
* Want to make this a **group project**? Propose an idea of what you'd like to create as a team, and an explanation of how you plan to allocate the work between you all.
* Missing `Java`? Didn't think so... but if you do, let me know and I can show you some advanced projects that students have made.

💡 Let me know if you'd like a custom-made **lesson**, **cheatsheet**, or **code demo**! I am happy to write new pages and add them to this unit, by request.
