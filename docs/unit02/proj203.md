### Overview & Setup

In this project, you will visualize and make calculations from medical examination data using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `pandas`. The dataset values were collected during medical examinations.

<div class="setup" markdown="block">

1. Go to the `CS3 Project 2.3` assignment on **Blackbaud** and follow the provided **GitHub Classroom** link.
  > üìÅ Clicking the link generates a **private repository** for your project with the appropriate starter code. Note that **projects** are stored within the [BWL-CS Organization](https://github.com/BWL-CS), so you _cannot_ access it from the "Your Repositories" page!
2. Open the repository in a **Codespace** whenever you spend time working on the program, in class or at home. 
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è Always remember to `commit changes` after every coding session!
3. When your project is complete, **submit the link to your repository** in the `CS3 Project 2.3` assignment on Blackbaud.

#### STARTER CODE

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Import data
df = None

# Add 'overweight' column
df['overweight'] = None

# Normalize data by making 0 always good and 1 always bad. If the value of 'cholesterol' or 'gluc' is 1, make the value 0. If the value is more than 1, make the value 1.


# Function to draw Categorical Plot
def draw_cat_plot():
  # Create DataFrame for cat plot using `pd.melt` using just the values from 'cholesterol', 'gluc', 'smoke', 'alco', 'active', and 'overweight'.
  df_cat = None

  # Group and reformat the data to split it by 'cardio'. Show the counts of each feature. You will have to rename one of the columns for the catplot to work correctly.
  df_cat = None

  # Draw the catplot with 'sns.catplot()'

  # Get the figure for the output
  fig = None

  # Do not modify the next two lines
  fig.savefig('catplot.png')
  return fig


# Function to draw Heat Map
def draw_heat_map():
  # Clean the data
  df_heat = None

  # Calculate the correlation matrix
  corr = None

  # Generate a mask for the upper triangle
  mask = None

  # Set up the matplotlib figure
  fig, ax = None

  # Draw the heatmap with 'sns.heatmap()'

  # Do not modify the next two lines
  fig.savefig('heatmap.png')
  return fig


# RUN FUNCTIONS
draw_cat_plot()
draw_heat_map()

```

#### Data description

The rows in the dataset represent patients and the columns represent information like body measurements, results from various blood tests, and lifestyle choices. You will use the dataset to explore the relationship between cardiac disease, body measurements, blood markers, and lifestyle choices.

File name: `medical_examination.csv`

| Feature | Variable Type | Variable      | Value Type |
|:-------:|:------------:|:-------------:|:----------:|
| Age | Objective Feature | `age` | int (days) |
| Height | Objective Feature | `height` | int (cm) |
| Weight | Objective Feature | `weight` | float (kg) |
| Gender | Objective Feature | `gender` | categorical code |
| Systolic blood pressure | Examination Feature | `ap_hi` | int |
| Diastolic blood pressure | Examination Feature | `ap_lo` | int |
| Cholesterol | Examination Feature | `cholesterol` | 1: normal, 2: above normal, 3: well above normal |
| Glucose | Examination Feature | `gluc` | 1: normal, 2: above normal, 3: well above normal |
| Smoking | Subjective Feature | `smoke` | binary |
| Alcohol intake | Subjective Feature | `alco` | binary |
| Physical activity | Subjective Feature | `active` | binary |
| Presence or absence of cardiovascular disease | Target Variable | `cardio` | binary |

### Instructions

#### Part A

<div class="task" markdown="1">

Create a chart where we show the counts of good and bad outcomes for the `cholesterol`, `gluc`, `alco`, `active`, and `smoke` variables for patients with `cardio=1` and `cardio=0` in different panels. Complete the following tasks in `main.py`:

1. Import the data from `medical_examination.csv` and assign it to the `df` variable
2. Create the `overweight` column in the `df` variable
3. Normalize data by making `0` always good and `1` always bad. If the value of `cholesterol` or `gluc` is 1, set the value to `0`. If the value is more than `1`, set the value to `1`.
4. Draw the Categorical Plot in the `draw_cat_plot` function
5. Create a DataFrame for the cat plot using `pd.melt` with values from `cholesterol`, `gluc`, `smoke`, `alco`, `active`, and `overweight` in the `df_cat` variable.
6. Group and reformat the data in `df_cat` to split it by `cardio`. Show the counts of each feature. You will have to rename one of the columns for the `catplot` to work correctly.
7. Convert the data into `long` format and create a chart that shows the value counts of the categorical features using the following method provided by the seaborn library import : `sns.catplot()`
8. Get the figure for the output and store it in the `fig` variable

#### Part B

<div class="task" markdown="1">

Draw the Heat Map in the `draw_heat_map` function:

1. Clean the data in the `df_heat` variable by filtering out the following patient segments that represent incorrect data:
    - height is less than the 2.5th percentile (Keep the correct data with `(df['height'] >= df['height'].quantile(0.025))`)
    - height is more than the 97.5th percentile
    - weight is less than the 2.5th percentile
    - weight is more than the 97.5th percentile
2. Calculate the correlation matrix and store it in the `corr` variable
3. Generate a mask for the upper triangle and store it in the `mask` variable
4. Set up the `matplotlib` figure 
5. Plot the **correlation matrix** using the method provided by the `seaborn` library import: `sns.heatmap()`
    - Mask the upper triangle.
