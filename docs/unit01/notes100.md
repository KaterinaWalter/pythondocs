## Introduction to the Python Language
### What is Python?

🐍 Python is a programming language created by Guido Van Rossum in the late 1980s. Python the language is [open source](https://github.com/python/cpython).

Python has a wide variety of **real-world applications** such as:

- AI/ML
    - SciPi
    - NumPy
    - Pandas
    - PyTorch
- Hardware & Micro-controllers
    - Raspberry Pi
    - MicroPython
    - CircuitPython
- Web Development
    - Django
    - Flask
- Scripting
    - DevOps
    Configuration scripts

Python has an incredibly rich fully featured [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/), as well as the [PyPI Package Index](https://pypi.org/) for 3rd party packages, which as of February 2019 contains 167,107 packages.

Python is considered to be a "batteries included" language, because the standard library contains a majority of the libraries and packages you'll need in a standard application.

#### PEP8 STYLE GUIDELINES
{:.no_toc}

[PEP8](https://pep8.org/) is a Python **coding standard**, that sets guidelines for how our Python code should look like. 
> 💬 How does the style guide for the Python language compare to the conventions we learned in Java last year? Or JavaScript from the year before?
